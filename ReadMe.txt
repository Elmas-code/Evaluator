Hello and welcome

This project is about rating evil fictitious professors of entertainment media.
It was made to train my skills in usability-programing
I hope you enjoy this and have some fun rating your favourite villains

To get the intended experience you click on landingPage.html, right in the first file you are in right now.
It will ask you for a password and a username. 
No worries, just write anything you want in it, and it should work.
Everything else was made with the intention to explain itself.
